# python-end-project
This program is designed to perform data analysis and visualization on an employee dataset

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.


 The program  performs the following tasks:

Distribution of employees across teams: It calculates the number of employees in each team and the corresponding percentage split relative to the total number of employees. The results are displayed in the console, and a bar chart is plotted to visualize the distribution.
Segregation by position: The program segregates the employees based on their positions within the company (e.g., manager, developer, analyst, etc.). It displays the count of employees for each position and visualizes the distribution using a pie chart.
Predominant age group: The program identifies the predominant age group among the employees by grouping them into age ranges (e.g., 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc.). The predominant age group is displayed, and a histogram is plotted to visualize the age distribution.
Salary expenditure: The program determines the team and position with the highest salary expenditure by grouping and summing the salaries for each team and position. The results are displayed, and bar charts are plotted to visualize the salary expenditure by team and position.
Age-salary correlation: The program investigates the correlation between age and salary by creating a scatterplot using the seaborn library. The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between an employee's age and their corresponding salary.
Throughout the analysis, the program makes use of various data manipulation and visualization techniques provided by the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The visualizations are displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot library, allowing for a better understanding and interpretation of the data.

Overall, this program provides insights into the employee dataset by analyzing various aspects such as team distribution, positions, age groups, salary expenditure, and the correlation between age and salary. The results are presented through both tabular and graphical formats for easier comprehension.
