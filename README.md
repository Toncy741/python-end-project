# python-end-project
This program is designed to perform data analysis and visualization on an employee dataset

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.


 The program  performs the following tasks:

Distribution of employees across teams: It calculates the number of employees in each team and the corresponding percentage split relative to the total number of employees. The results are displayed in the console, and a bar chart is plotted to visualize the distribution.
Segregation by position: The program segregates the employees based on their positions within the company (e.g., manager, developer, analyst, etc.). It displays the count of employees for each position and visualizes the distribution using a pie chart.
Predominant age group: The program identifies the predominant age group among the employees by grouping them into age ranges (e.g., 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc.). The predominant age group is displayed, and a histogram is plotted to visualize the age distribution.
Salary expenditure: The program determines the team and position with the highest salary expenditure by grouping and summing the salaries for each team and position. The results are displayed, and bar charts are plotted to visualize the salary expenditure by team and position.
Age-salary correlation: The program investigates the correlation between age and salary by creating a scatterplot using the seaborn library. The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between an employee's age and their corresponding salary.
Throughout the analysis, the program makes use of various data manipulation and visualization techniques provided by the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The visualizations are displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot library, allowing for a better understanding and interpretation of the data.

 explanation of the bar chart visualizations for each question:

1. **Distribution of employees across teams and percentage split**:
The bar chart visualizes the distribution of employees across different teams. Each bar represents a team, and the height of the bar corresponds to the number of employees in that team. This visualization provides a clear understanding of the relative size of each team in terms of employee count.

2. **Segregate employees based on positions**:
This visualization is not a bar chart. Instead, it uses a pie chart to display the distribution of employees across different positions within the company. Each slice of the pie represents a position, and the size of the slice is proportional to the number of employees in that position. This visualization helps in understanding the relative representation of different positions in the workforce.

3. **Identify the predominant age group**:
The visualization for this question is a histogram. A histogram is a graphical representation that displays the distribution of a continuous variable, in this case, age. The x-axis represents the age groups (e.g., 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc.), and the y-axis represents the count or frequency of employees in each age group. The bars in the histogram show the number of employees falling into each age group. This visualization helps identify the age group with the highest concentration of employees, which is considered the predominant age group.

4. **Team and position with highest salary expenditure**:
There are two bar chart visualizations for this question:

   a. **Salary expenditure by team**: This bar chart displays the total salary expenditure for each team. Each bar represents a team, and the height of the bar corresponds to the sum of salaries for employees in that team. This visualization helps identify the team with the highest salary expenditure, which can provide insights into team budgets and resource allocation.

   b. **Salary expenditure by position**: Similar to the team salary expenditure, this bar chart shows the total salary expenditure for each position within the company. Each bar represents a position, and the height of the bar corresponds to the sum of salaries for employees in that position. This visualization helps identify the positions with the highest salary expenditure, which can be useful for understanding the relative importance or demand for certain roles within the organization.

5. **Correlation between age and salary**:
The visualization for this question is a scatterplot. A scatterplot is a graphical representation that displays the relationship between two continuous variables. In this case, the x-axis represents the age of employees, and the y-axis represents their corresponding salaries. Each data point on the scatterplot represents an individual employee, with their age and salary values plotted on the respective axes. By analyzing the pattern and distribution of the data points, the scatterplot helps to visualize the correlation (if any) between age and salary. A positive correlation would indicate that higher salaries are associated with older employees, while a negative correlation would suggest that higher salaries are associated with younger employees.

These visualizations provide a graphical representation of the data, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. They complement the numerical analysis by presenting the information in a more visually appealing and intuitive manner.

Overall, this program provides insights into the employee dataset by analyzing various aspects such as team distribution, positions, age groups, salary expenditure, and the correlation between age and salary. The results are presented through both tabular and graphical formats for easier comprehension.
